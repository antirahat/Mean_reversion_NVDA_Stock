# Mean_reversion_NVDA_Stock
I applied mean reversion strategy on NVDA stock to analyze how it performs. I used python's pandas,numpy framework to analyze my data. 

What is mean reversion?
- Mean reversion is a financial theory which suggests that, after an extreme price move, asset prices tend to return back to normal or average levels. Prices routinely oscillate around the mean or average price but tend to return to that same average price over and over

Due to recent uptrend in NVDA stock buy/hold strategy outperforms Mean Reversion Strategy.
